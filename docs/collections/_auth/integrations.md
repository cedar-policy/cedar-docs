# Integrations with Cedar

Cedar integrations help you implement fine-grained authorization in your applications while minimizing code and following framework-specific best practices. These integrations provide middleware components and 
utilities that seamlessly connect your application with Cedar.

With integrations, you can:  
• Implement authorization in minutes  
• Follow framework-specific patterns and conventions  
• Reduce maintenance overhead  
• Minimize potential security implementation errors  
• Focus on business logic rather than authorization code  

When added to your application, integrations do the following:
1. Intercept incoming requests through framework-specific middleware
2. Extract relevant authorization context from requests
3. Determine authorization decisions using Cedar
4. Enforce access control based on authorization results
