## Allows access to individual entities {#allow-acces-indivuals}
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows the user `alice` to view the photo `VacationPhoto94.jpg`.

```Cedar
permit(
  principal == User::"alice", 
  action == Action::"view", 
  resource == Photo::"VacationPhoto94.jpg"
);
```

## Allows access to groups of entities {#allow-acces-groups}
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows anyone in the `alice_friends` group to view the photo `VacationPhoto94.jpg`.

```Cedar
permit(
  principal in Group::"alice_friends", 
  action == Action::"view", 
  resource == Photo::"VacationPhoto94.jpg"
);
```
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows the user `alice` to view any photo in the album `alice_vacation`.

```Cedar
permit(
  principal == User::"alice", 
  action == Action::"view", 
  resource in Album::"alice_vacation"
);
```
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows the user `alice` to view, edit, or delete any photo in the album `alice_vacation`.

```Cedar
permit(
  principal == User::"alice", 
  action in [Action::"view", Action::"edit", Action::"delete"], 
  resource in Album::"alice_vacation"
);
```
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows permissions for the user `alice` in the album `alice_vacation`, where `admin` is a group defined in the schema hierarchy that contains the permissions to view, edit, and delete a photo.

```Cedar
permit(
  principal == User::"alice", 
  action in Photoflash::Role::"admin", 
  resource in Album::"alice_vacation"
);
```
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows permissions for the user `alice` in the album `alice_vacation`, where `viewer` is a group defined in the schema hierarchy that contains the permission to view and comment on a photo. The user `alice` is also granted the `edit` permission by the second action listed in the policy.

```Cedar
permit(
  principal == User::"alice", 
  action in [PhotoflashRole::"viewer", Action::"edit"],
  resource in Album::"alice_vacation"
)
```
## Allows access for any entity {#allow-any}
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows any authenticated principal to view the album `alice_vacation`.
```Cedar
permit(
  principal,
  action == Action::"view", 
  resource in Album::"alice_vacation"
);
```
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows the user `alice` to list all the albums in the `jane` account, list the photos in each album, and view photos in the account.
```Cedar
permit(
  principal == User::"alice", 
  action in [Action::"listAlbums", Action::"listPhotos", Action::"view"],
  resource in Account::"jane"
);
```
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows the user `alice` to perform any action on resources in the album `jane_vaction`.
```Cedar
permit(
  principal == User::"alice", 
  action,
  resource in Album::"jane_vacation"
);
```
## Allows access for attributes of an entity (ABAC) {#allow-abac}
Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines permissions based on attributes. Cedar allows attributes to be attached to principals, actions, and resources. These attributes can then be referenced within the `when` and `unless` clauses of policies that evaluate the attributes of the principals, actions, and resources that make up the context of the request.

This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows any principal in the `HardwareEngineering` department with a job level of greater than or equal to 5 to view and list photos in the album `device_prototypes`.
```Cedar
permit(
  principal,
  action in [Action::"listPhotos", Action::"view"],
  resource in Album::"device_prototypes"
)
when {
  principal.department == "HardwareEngineering" &&
  principal.jobLevel >= 5
};
```
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows the user `alice` to view any resource of file type `JPEG`.
```Cedar
permit(
  principal == User::"alice",
  action == Action::"view",
  resource
)
when {
  resource.fileType == "JPEG"
};
```
Actions have *context attributes*. You must pass these attributes in the `context` of an authorization request. This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows the user `alice` to perform any `readOnly` action. You can also set an `appliesTo` property for actions in your schema. This specifies valid actions for a resource when you want to ensure that, for example, users can only attempt to authorize `ViewPhoto` for a resource of type `PhotoFlash::Photo`.
```Cedar
permit(
  principal == PhotoFlash::User::"alice",
  action,
  resource
) when { 
    context has readOnly && 
    context.readOnly == true 
};
```
A better way to set the properties of actions in your schema, however, is to arrange them into functional action groups. For example, you can create an action named `ReadOnlyPhotoAccess` and set `PhotoFlash::Action::"ViewPhoto"` to be a member of `ReadOnlyPhotoAccess` as an action group. This following example shows how you might create a policy that grants Alice access to the read-only actions in that group.
```Cedar
permit(
  principal == PhotoFlash::User::"alice",
  action in PhotoFlash::Action::"ReadOnlyPhotoAccess",
  resource
);
```
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows all principals to perform any action on resources for which they have `owner` attribute.
```Cedar
permit(
  principal,
  action,
  resource
)
when {
  principal == resource.owner
};
```
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows any principal to view any resource if the `department` attribute for the principal matches the `department` attribute of the resource.

**Note**: If an entity doesn't have an attribute mentioned in a policy condition, then the policy will be ignored when making an authorization decision and evaluation of that policy fails for that entity. For example, any principal that does not have a `department` attribute cannot be granted access to any resource by this policy. 

```Cedar
permit(
  principal,
  action == Action::"view",
  resource
)
when {
  principal.department == resource.owner.department
};
```
This following example shows how you might create a policy that allows any principal to perform any action on a resource if the principal is the `owner` of the resource OR if the principal is part of the `admins` group for the resource.
```Cedar
permit(
  principal,
  action,
  resource,
)
when {
  principal == resource.owner ||
  resource.admins.contains(principal)
};
```

## Denies access {#deny-access}
If a policy contains `forbid` for the effect of the policy, it constrains permissions instead of granting permissions.

**Note**: During authorization, if both a `permit` and `forbid` policy are enforced, the `forbid` takes precedence.

This following example shows how you might create a policy that denies the user `alice` from performing all actions except `readOnly` on any resource.

```Cedar
forbid (
  principal == User::"alice",
  action,
  resource
)
unless {
  action.readOnly
};
```
This following example shows how you might create a policy that denies access to all resources that have a `private` attribute unless the principal has the `owner` attribute for the resource.

```Cedar
forbid (
  principal,
  action,
  resource
)
when {
  resource.private
}
unless {
  principal == resource.owner
};
```
